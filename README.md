# Twizy_Project
Vasu Bhog 2019 

Goal:
Recongize and Detect Road Signs in Real Time. 

Learn about OpenCV, Image Processing, Real Time Data Proccessing, Computer Vision Techniques.

Background:

Autonomous vehicles and robots need to perceive their environments
 - Including other vehicles, objects, pedestrians, signs
 - Perceive -> Analyze â€“> Act
 
The detection and recognition of road signs is essential for the movement of vehicles on the roads

We will use several on-board data acquisition sensors
 - On-board cameras 3D
 -LIDAR

Lastly our goal is the analysis of captured images to detect shapes and
objects in the vehicle environment

Enviornment and Tools:
-Twizy Electric Vehicle
-GoPro Hero Camera
-Test Road Signs

Further Work:
Studying of object detection and recongition algorithms (MATLAB, OpenCV Library, and Java Programming)
Machine Learning Algorithm combination with current implementation
