# Twizy_Project
Vasu Bhog 2019

Goal: Recognize and Detect Road Signs in Real Time.

Learn about OpenCV, Image Processing, Real-Time Data Processing, Computer Vision Techniques.

Background:

Autonomous vehicles and robots need to perceive their environments
 - Including other vehicles, objects, pedestrians, signs
 - Perceive -> Analyze â€“> Act
 
The detection and recognition of road signs is essential for the movement of vehicles on the roads

We will use several onboard data acquisition sensors
 -Onboard cameras 3D 
 -LIDAR

Lastly, our goal is the analysis of captured images to detect shapes and objects in the vehicle environment

Environment and Tools: 
-Twizy Electric Vehicle
-GoPro Hero Camera
-Test Road Signs
-Java (Eclipse)

Further Work:
Studying of object detection and recognition algorithms (MATLAB, OpenCV Library, and Java Programming) Machine Learning Algorithm combination with the current implementation
